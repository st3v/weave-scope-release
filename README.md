weave-scope-release
===================

Bosh release for [Weave Scope](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope). This can be used to deploy the Scope App and Scope Probes.  While the App should be deployed through a regular Bosh deployment, the Probes are meant to be deployed as a Bosh addon.

There is currently a [documented procedure](https://github.com/bendalby82/weave-scope-release/blob/master/docs/vsphere-install-guide.md) to deploy the Scope App and Scope Probes in a vSphere environment, and also [a simple procedure](https://github.com/bendalby82/weave-scope-release/blob/master/docs/static-local-copy.md) to run the Scope App locally against a saved JSON data file.
